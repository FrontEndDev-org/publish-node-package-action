Publish a NodeJS package to NPM Repository or GitHub Packages

# Publish to NPM Repository

PreRequirements

-   Make sure you've stored a NPM **Classic Token** (an "Automation" token) as a secret in your repository. You can generate one at <https://www.npmjs.com/settings/your-username/tokens>.
-   If you want to publish scope package, You need to apply to create an organization on npmjs.com，at <https://www.npmjs.com/org/create>.
-   Support for [npm package provenance statements](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements)

```yaml
jobs:
    publish-npm:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            contents: read
            id-token: write # Give permission to mint an ID-token
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - run: npm ci
            - run: npm run build
            - uses: FrontEndDev-org/publish-node-package-action@v2
              with:
                  target: npm
                  token: ${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}
```

# Publish to GitHub Packages

PreRequirements

-   Requires GitHub Packages write access
-   No need to publish token

Notes

-   GitHub Packages `name` may change after release, in two cases:
    1. For example, the original name `my-pkg` will be changed to `@owner/my-kg`, where `owner` is the name of the
       owner name of the current repository
    2. For example, the original name `@my-scope/my-pkg` will be changed to `@owner/my-scope__my-kg`, where `owner` is the owner name of the current repository
-   The name attribute in package.json in the repository will not be modified

```yaml
jobs:
    publish-github:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        permissions:
            packages: write
        steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - run: npm ci
            - run: npm run build
            - uses: FrontEndDev-org/publish-node-package-action@v2
              with:
                  target: github
                  token: ${{ github.token }}
